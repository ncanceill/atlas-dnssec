# DNSSEC measurements with Atlas

This is a collection of [Python 2](https://www.python.org) scripts that were used in a study I conducted in April 2014 at the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl), entitled _Measuring DNSSEC deployment over the Internet_. I used the RIPE [Atlas network](https://atlas.ripe.net) and [Wireshark](http://www.wireshark.org) in order to run the measurements.

I wrote the [`tools.py`](https://github.com/ncanceill/atlas-dnssec/blob/master/tools.py) and [`run.py`](https://github.com/ncanceill/atlas-dnssec/blob/master/run.py) myself, and I am making them publicly available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/ncanceill/atlas-dnssec/blob/master/LICENSE). The [`atlas.py`](https://github.com/ncanceill/atlas-dnssec/blob/master/atlas.py) script was provided by my supervisors from [NLnet Labs](http://nlnetlabs.nl), and distributes under [their own terms](https://github.com/ncanceill/atlas-dnssec/blob/master/atlas.py#L3-L32).
